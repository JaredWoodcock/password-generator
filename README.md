# Password-Generator
Module 3 Challenge - Password Generator

In this challenge, I finished the Javascript coding to complete the Password Generator.
<ul>When the generate password button is clicked, it presents a series of prompts for password criteria.</ul>
<ul>When prompted for password criteria, the user can select which criteria to include in the password.</ul>
<ul>When prompted for the length of the password, then the user has to choose a number between 8 and 128 or else they will get an error.</ul>
<ul>When asked for what character types to include in the password, then the user can confirm whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters.</ul>
<ul>When each prompt is answered, then those selections are reflected in the generated password. If no selection is made, it gives the user an error.</ul>
<ul>When the password is generated, it is displayed on the page in the "Your Secure Password" box.</ul>
